# Battle Game – Python OOP Project

## Overview

This is a simple console-based Battle Game built in Python to practice and demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming concepts after revising Python fundamentals. The project focuses on applying programming logic, class structure, and interaction between objects in a practical scenario.

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is learning and practice. Instead of only studying theory, this program applies OOP principles in a working game simulation to strengthen problem-solving skills and coding structure.

## Features

* Turn-based battle system
* Player vs Enemy combat
* Attack, Special Attack, and Defense actions
* Health bar display system
* Randomized damage mechanics
* Clean and structured class design

## OOP Concepts Used

* Classes and Objects
* Encapsulation (private health attribute)
* Method interaction between objects
* State management through class variables
* Reusability through inheritance structure

## How to Run

1. Install Python (3.x recommended)
2. Download or clone the repository
3. Run the file:


python filename.py


## Learning Outcome

This project helped improve:

* Logic building
* Program flow understanding
* Class design thinking
* Practical implementation of OOP

## Future Improvements

* Level system
* Inventory system
* Multiple enemies
* Save/load feature
* GUI version
